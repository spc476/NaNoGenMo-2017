                                 Love is ...

                            A Definitional Novel
                        in 4 expansions and 170007 words

                           Created by Sean Conner.
          Based upon an idea from Douglas Hofstadter from his book
     _Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern_

  This is my 2017 entry into NaNoGenMo [1].  The idea behind this is a very
simple algorithm:

	1. Set our corpus to a single word, "love."
	2. For each word in our corpus, replace said word with its definition.
	3. If we haven't reached 50,000 word, repeat step 2.

  Like I said, simple.

  Not so simple was getting an online dictionary parsed to the point where
this could be accomplished.  That took a few days of work.  The actual work
of writing the algorithm above was about an hour or so, then a few seconds
work for the computer to spew out 170,000 words.

  I was surprised that it look so few interations to balloon up like it did. 
I guess (?) I expected more iterations, like 10 or so.  But four?  Wow.

  This isn't as impressive as my 2015 entry [2] (which required me to
implement enough of MS-DOS to run a 30+ year old compiled BASIC program) but
it still required more work that I expected---I expected this to be just a
warm-up exercise for this year, but I figure that I should save my ideas for
following years.  I don't want a repeat of last year (where I couldn't come
up with an idea).

  Enjoy.
